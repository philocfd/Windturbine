Example setup for windturbine simulation using different methods.
OpenFOAM has many versions and the code structrue is keep changing. So the setup may be different for different versions.
This resporsitory holds the set up of the cases I used for my vesrion. Some of them are adapted from the open cases.
In that case,the original source will be listed. Hopefully it's helpful for you to set your cases.
